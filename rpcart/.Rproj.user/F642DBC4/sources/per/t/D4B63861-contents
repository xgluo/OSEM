The `REVOLVER` package implements a statistical model to determine trajectories of repeated evolution in a cohort of multi-region sequencing datasets.

The repeatability of evolution is measured with a new method that extracts evolutionary trajectories within a single patient (intra-tumour), and correlates them against the cohort (inter-patient).

The correlation across patients is measured extracting evolutionary trajectories from the *phylogenetic ordering* of driver alterations detected from the patients' trees. Drivers must be annotated in the input genome sequencing data, and shall occur across multiple patients.

### Analysis pipeline


A `REVOLVER` analysis follows the following steps (the main function to implement the step is reported):

1. create a `REVOLVER` cohort (`revolver_cohort`);
  
2. generate phylogenetic trees for each patient in the cohort (`compute_clone_trees`, `compute_mutation_trees`, etc.);

3. fit the best tree to a patient's data, correlating the fit with the other patients' trees (`revolver_fit`);

4. cluster the cohort into groups of patients whose tumours follow similar patterns of repeated evolution (`revolver_cluster`);

5. evaluate different measures confidence for the clusters using jackknife statistics (`revolver_jackknife`);;

At the end of each one of these steps, you can use a number of `REVOLVER` functions to inspect or plot the results of the analysis.

### Vignettes

The following vignettes are available:

1. [Introduction:](https://caravagnalab.github.io/revolver/articles/Input_formats.html) which discusses input formats, and the creation of  a `REVOLVER` cohort from input sequencing data;

2. [Getter functions:](https://caravagnalab.github.io/revolver/articles/Getters.html) which discusses different getter functions to extract information from a `REVOLVER` cohort;

3. [Plotting functions:](https://caravagnalab.github.io/revolver/articles/Plotting_functions.html) which discusses different plotting functions to visualize cohorts, data, fits etc.;
